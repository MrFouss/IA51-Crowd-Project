# IA51 Crowd Project

This project aims to put into practice our knowledge about agent oriented programming and [SARL](http://www.sarl.io/).

To launch the application, download the JAR file from the releases, and launch it with the following command:
```
jar --java [path]/crowdproject-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

This project was created using the SARL programming language, and runs on the [Janus platform](http://www.janusproject.io/). It uses the graphical API JavaFX and the [dyn4j](http://www.dyn4j.org/) physics engine / collision detector.
